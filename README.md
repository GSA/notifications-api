# US Notify API

This project is the core of [Notify](https://notifications-admin.app.cloud.gov/). It's cloned from the brilliant work of the team at [GOV.UK Notify](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-api), cheers!

This repo contains:

- A public-facing REST API for Notify, which teams can integrate with using [API clients built by UK](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation)
- An internal-only REST API built using Flask to manage services, users, templates, etc., which the [admin UI](http://github.com/18F/notifications-admin) talks to)
- Asynchronous workers built using Celery to put things on queues and read them off to be processed, sent to providers, updated, etc.

Our other repositories are:

- [notifications-admin](https://github.com/GSA/notifications-admin)
- [notifications-utils](https://github.com/GSA/notifications-utils)
- [us-notify-compliance](https://github.com/GSA/us-notify-compliance/)
- [notify-python-demo](https://github.com/GSA/notify-python-demo)


## Local setup

### Common steps

On MacOS, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management is highly recommended. This helps avoid some known installation issues.

1. Install pre-requisites for setup:
    * [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): `brew install jq`
    * [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): `brew install terraform` or `brew install tfenv` and use `tfenv` to install `terraform ~> 1.4.0`
    * [cf-cli@8](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html): `brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli@8`
    * [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/): `brew install postgresql@15` (Homebrew requires a version pin, but any recent version will work)
    * [redis](https://redis.io/): `brew install redis`
    * [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv): `brew install pyenv`
1. [Log into cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/setup/#set-up-the-command-line): `cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso`
1. Ensure you have access to the `notify-local-dev` and `notify-staging` spaces in cloud.gov
1. Run the development terraform with:

        ```
        $ cd terraform/development
        $ ./run.sh
        ```

1. If you want to send data to New Relic from your local develpment environment, set `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` within `.env`
1. Follow the instructions for either `Direct installation` or `Docker installation` below

### Direct installation

1. Set up Postgres && Redis on your machine

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

1. Run the project setup

    `make bootstrap`

1. Run the web server and background worker

    `make run-procfile`

1. Or run them individually:

    * Run Flask (web server)

        `make run-flask`

    * Run Celery (background worker)

        `make run-celery`


### VS Code && Docker installation

If you're working in VS Code, you can also leverage Docker for a containerized dev environment

1. Uncomment the `Local Docker setup` lines in `.env` and comment out the `Local direct setup` lines.

1. Install the Remote-Containers plug-in in VS Code

1. With Docker running, create the network:

    `docker network create notify-network`

1. Using the command palette (shift+cmd+p) or green button thingy in the bottom left, search and select ‚ÄúRemote Containers: Open Folder in Container...‚Äù When prompted, choose **devcontainer-api** folder (note: this is a *subfolder* of notifications-api). This will start the container in a new window, replacing the current one.

1. Wait a few minutes while things happen üçµ

1. Open a VS Code terminal and run the Flask application:

    `make run-flask`

1. Open another VS Code terminal and run Celery:

    `make run-celery`

NOTE: when you change .env in the future, you'll need to rebuild the devcontainer for the change to take effect. VS Code _should_ detect the change and prompt you with a toast notification during a cached build. If not, you can find a manual rebuild in command pallette or just `docker rm` the notifications-api container.

### Known installation issues

On M1 Macs, if you get a `fatal error: 'Python.h' file not found` message, try a different method of installing Python. Installation via `pyenv` is known to work.

A direct installation of PostgreSQL will not put the `createdb` command on your `$PATH`. It can be added there in your shell startup script, or a Homebrew-managed installation of PostgreSQL will take care of it.
