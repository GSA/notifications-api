# API Usage

## Connecting to the API

To make life easier, the [UK API client libraries](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation) are compatible with Notify.

For a usage example, see [our Python demo](https://github.com/GSA/notify-python-demo).

An API key can be created at https://notifications-admin.app.cloud.gov/services/YOUR_SERVICE_ID/api/keys. However, in order to successfully send messages, you will need to receive a secret header token from the Notify team.
