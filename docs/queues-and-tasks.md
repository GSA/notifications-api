# Queues and tasks

The API puts tasks into Celery queues for dispatch.

There are a bunch of queues:
- priority tasks
- database tasks
- send sms tasks
- send email tasks
- research mode tasks
- reporting tasks
- job tasks
- retry tasks
- notify internal tasks
- process ftp tasks
- create letters pdf tasks
- service callbacks
- service callbacks retry
- letter tasks
- sms callbacks
- antivirus tasks
- sanitise letter tasks
- save api email tasks
- save api sms tasks

And these tasks:
- check for missing rows in completed jobs
- check for services with high failure rates or sending to tv numbers
- check if letters still in created
- check if letters still pending virus check
- check job status
- collate letter pdfs to be sent
- create fake letter response file
- create nightly billing
- create nightly billing for day
- create nightly notification status
- create nightly notification status for service and day
- delete email notifications
- delete inbound sms
- delete invitations

- delete notifications for service and type
- delete notifications older than retention
- delete sms notifications
- delete verify codes
- deliver email

## Priority queue

For tasks that should happen before other stuff, there's a priority queue. Platform admins
can set templates to use this queue.

Currently, this queue doesn't do anything special. If the normal queue is very busy, it's
possible that this queue will be faster merely because it's shorter. By the same logic, a 
busy priority queue is likely to be _slower_ than the normal queue

## Celery scheduled tasks

After scheduling some tasks, run celery beat to get them moving:

```
make run-celery-beat
```
