### Notes

#### Note 1.

Users and invited users are Federal, State, or Local government employees or contractors. Members of the general public are _not_ users of the system

#### Note 2.

Field-level encryption is used on these fields.

Details on encryption schemes and algorithms can be found in [SC-28(1)](https://github.com/GSA/us-notify-compliance/blob/main/dist/system-security-plans/lato/sc-28.1.md)

Data Retention Policy
---------------------

Seven (7) days by default. Each service can be set with a custom policy via `ServiceDataRetention` by a Platform Admin. The `ServiceDataRetention` setting applies per-service and per-message type and controls both entries in the `notifications` table as well as `csv` contact files uploaded to s3

Data cleanup is controlled by several tasks in the `nightly_tasks.py` file, kicked off by Celery Beat.
